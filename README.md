### In Progress

Developing a **TileGrid** that contains a 2D array of **Tile** objects. Each Tile can hold a GameObject that occupies that space in the grid. Depending on which tiles are occupied a **Path** object can be determined to go from one tile to another within a constraint of a certain amount of spaces.
